            <img src="images/c1.jpeg" alt="Diwali">
            <p>Diwali (also: Deepawali) is one of India's biggest festivals. The word 'Deepawali' means rows of lighted
                lamps. It is a Festival of Lights and Hindus celebrate it with joy. During this festival, people light
                up their houses and shops with Diyas (small cup-shaped oil lamp made of baked clay). They worship the
                Lord Ganesha for welfare and prosperity and Goddess Lakshmi for wealth and wisdom.

                Balabhadra and sister Goddess Subhadra from their temple Srimandira to the Gundicha Temple, which is
                believed to be the Lord’s garden house and birthplace (two miles away), in elaborately decorated
                chariots. It is one of the biggest festivals in Odisha and is attended by thousands of devotees and
                followers of the deities.

                chariots used for transporting the deities are decorated with flowers, paintings, small statuettes, wood
                carvings and brass engraving.

    <p>India is one of the oldest civilizations in the world with a kaleidoscopic variety and rich cultural heritage. It
      has achieved all-round socio-economic progress during the last 65 years of its Independence. India has become
      self-sufficient in agricultural production and is now one of the top industrialized countries in the world and
      one of the few nations to have gone into outer space to conquer nature for the benefit of the people. It covers
      an area of 32, 87,263 sq. km, extending from the snow-covered Himalayan heights to the tropical rain forests of
      the south. As the 7th largest country in the world, India stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it
      is by mountains and the sea, which give the country a distinct geographical entity. Bounded by the Great
      Himalayas in the north, it stretches southwards and at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers off into the Indian Ocean
      between the Bay of Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west. As you travel, India offers a range of
      vast tourism choices, diverse in land and nature, people, tribes, cuisine, faiths, dance forms, music, arts,
      crafts, adventure, sport, spirituality, history; even these vary as you journey from one state to another. As a
      country, India has achieved all-round socio-economic progress in the last 70 years of independence. The change
      is clearly visible in the Tier I and Tier II cities. However, the fascinating aspect lies in the stark
      difference as you travel through the new and old parts of its cities. From world-class airports and hotels,
      luxurious shopping malls, restaurants, pubs and cafes to overcrowded streets and alleyways, in the same cities,
      filled with thousands of little shops offering every possible modern and ethnic product and native street food
      is a fascinating experience.</p>

    <h2>History Of India</h2>

    <p>The Indian Peninsula stands apart from the rest of Asia, bordered as it is by mountains and the sea, which gives
      the country a distinct geographical entity. Based on the phases of evolution of the country and its people the
      history of India can be categorised in three major categories:</p>

          Medieval History

          For a period that has come to be so strongly associated with the Islamic influence and rule in India, Medieval
          Indian history went for almost three whole centuries under the so-called indigenous rulers, that included the
          Chalukyas, the Pallavas, etc..</p>

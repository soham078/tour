                <h4><b>Statue of Unity</b></h4>
                <p>Itâ€™s huge, almost gigantic! That is the first reaction most people have as they speed down the
                    winding road leading to the towering Statue of Unity (SoU). A long bridge connects the mainland to the Sadhu
                    Bet Island, on which the statue stands. Silhouetted against the surrounding Vindhya and Satpura mountain
                    ranges, the colossal statue almost seems to pierce the skyline.</p>

                <p>A lush carpet of rolling green, interrupted by low rises of mountains of the gorgeous Western
                    Ghats, Munnar, in Kerala, is dotted with huge emerald plantations and pristine waterfalls. No matter where
                    you go in Munnar, a mixed scent of tea, coffee and cardamom will follow you everywhere. With a bountiful of
                    natural treasures, Munnar leaves one rapt with its spectacular and awe-inspiring views. Such is the beauty
                    of the myriad shades of green of the landscape that Munnar is often called the Kashmir of South India.</p>

                <h4><b>Shillong</b></h4>
                <p>Colonial-era charm, a landscape of rolling green and pristine mountains come together to bring
                    to life the city of Shillong, the capital of Meghalaya. Its vistas are accentuated by pine trees, streams,
                    waterfalls and lush green parks. With a picturesque location about 1,525 m above sea level, on a plateau
                    surrounded by hills, Shillong makes for a pleasant tourist destination throughout the year. The plateau is
                    bound by Umiam to the north, the Diengiei Hills to the northwest and the hills of the Assam Valley on the
                    northeast.</p>

                <p> Often referred to as the cultural capital of Kerala, Thrissur is a centre point of energetic
                    festivities. This city hosts its own film festival, the Thrissur International Film Festival, among many
                    other cultural events throughout the year. It invites tourists for its rich culture and heritage as it
                    carries a strong influence of Indian, European and Arab sources from medieval and colonial times.</p>
